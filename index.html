            <h2>Expert Review</h2>
            <p>In this project, we worked with James Madison University's library to run a usability test and assess the usability of their eBook resources. We wanted to see what preferences the students held and how they interacted with the different interfaces that James Madison University provided for them. 
<p>In order to do this, we had five students perform a variety of tasks in three separate eBook platforms. Prior to this, I evaluated the eBook platforms on my own according to Nielsen's heuristics and Peter Morville's Honeycomb heuristics.</p>

            <h2>Expert Review</h2>
             <p>My group for this project decided to study the website Various Small Flames, located at <a href= "https://varioussmallflames.co.uk/">http://varioussmallflames.co.uk</a>, as we were looking to create a website with articles focused on local music. This is a website mainly focused on music reviews of bands with a small following, but it also contains interviews with the bands/artists, previews of new music, and reviews of books that are either about music or written by prominent musicians.</p>

            <h2>Expert Review</h2>
            <p>This is an expert review of Blake Hesterâ€™s portfolio website, located at <a href= "http://blakehester.rocks/">http://blakehester.rocks/</a>. His portfolio is what I consider to be a strong one that makes good choices both in how he displays the content of his portfolio and in the content itself.  This report contains an overview of the persona and the heuristics I used to evaluate the website.  The review evaluates the website in a way that might expose issues I could run into or should consider in creating a similar website. </p>
